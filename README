h1. Cake Pattern in JDK8

Spring has recently released support for Scala (see http://blog.springsource.org/2012/12/10/introducing-spring-scala/).
This of course can't go unheeded and there is only one correct way to counter this: Outlining of the Cake Pattern for
Java. ;-)

In order to create unnecessary confusion I try to illustrate the principles by implementing an extremely simple cake
database with web frontend through the Cake Pattern.

h2. What is the Cake Pattern?

The Cake Pattern is dependency injection's type safe and annotation/xml-free cousin. It works by creating traits for
each module. Traits in Scala are basically interfaces with state and methods. These traits then layered on top of each
other into a concrete class or object; a cake. You can combine these modules in different ways to create different cakes
according to different demands.

h2. How is it possible?

JDK8 includes among other handsome features something called virtual extension methods. This opens for adding code into
interfaces. In order to use the code in this project now (22. december 2012) you will need to download the lambda
version of JDK8. You'll find it here: http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/

h2. How it's done?

Each module will have a method that return the needed dependency, for example we have in my example the DbModule which
will return a Db-implementation:

    public interface DbModule {
        Db getDb();
    }

... which returns this interface:

    public interface Db {
        void create(String name);
        List<String> getCakes();
    }

Other layers in the cake can now use the database through a simple call to 'module.getDb()

* Inner class doesn't real have a relationship to the interface so we inject it as module
* Ordering important; most basic first
* SingletonModuleImpl: Might need other implementations
* How to initialise: Scala can declare variables in the scope
* Dirty shameful details added to the framework package
